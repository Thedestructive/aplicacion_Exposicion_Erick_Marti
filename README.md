# Settings Activity with Shared Preferences

App settings let users indicate preferences for how an app should behave.
Including settings in your app gives your users the power to control some of the functionality of your app. This makes your users happy instead of angryâ€”because they are now in control of how the app behaves. 

It's highly recommended to give access to app settings. This will provide a better user experience for your users, which leads to a better review on the Google Play store,
which then eventually gives rise to a higher number of app downloads
